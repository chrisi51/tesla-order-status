# Tesla Order Status Tracker (TOST) 🚗📦
Stay in control of your Tesla order from the moment you place it until delivery. This open-source Python tool gives you direct access to the Tesla API so you always know what is happening with your vehicle.

## Why You'll Love It
- 🔍 **Direct Tesla API connection**: Get the latest order information without any detours.
- 🧾 **Display of important details**: Vehicle options, production and delivery progress.
- 🕒 **History at a glance**: Every change (e.g. VIN allocation) is documented locally.
- 📋 **One‑click share mode**: Anonymized clipboard for forums and social media
- 🧩 **Modular & expandable**: Option codes, languages and features can be flexibly expanded.
- 🔐 **Privacy-focused**: Tokens and settings remain on your device – telemetry is completely optional.

The goal is to give users more transparency and control over the ordering process – without depending on external services.

## Get Started
Download the complete project to your machine. If you are unsure how, you can grab the ZIP archive directly from GitHub: https://github.com/chrisi51/tesla-order-status/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
> ⚠️ Do not run single scripts without the rest of the repository. Everything is meant to work together.

## Installation

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system.
2. Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install requests pyperclip
```
- requests: for the api calls (required)
- pyperclip: for copying share output to the clipboard automatically (optional)

### macOS Tip
For a clean setup, create a virtual environment before installing dependencies:
```sh
# create the environment
python3 -m venv .venv
# activate it
source .venv/bin/activate
# install dependencies just for this project
python3 -m pip install requests pyperclip
```

## Usage
Run the main script to fetch and display your order details:
```sh
python3 tesla_order_status.py
```
### Optional flags:
Get an overview of all command-line options:
```sh
python3 tesla_order_status.py --help
```
#### Output Modes
Only one of the options can be used at a time.
- `--all` display every available key in your history (verbose output)
- `--details` show additional information such as financing details.
- `--share` hide personal data like order ID and VIN for sharing. limits output to dates and status changes.
- `--status` only report whether the order information has changed since the last run. no login happens, so tesla_tokens.json have to be present already. token will get refreshed if necessary.
  - 0 => no changes
  - 1 => changes detected
  - 2 => pending updates
  - -1 => error ... you better run the script once without any params to make sure, it is working. Possibly the api token is invalid or there is no tesla_orders.json already
    
> 💡 Whenever `pyperclip` is installed, a share-friendly summary is copied to your clipboard. `--share` is not needed anymore for that.

#### Work Modes
Work modes can be combined with any output mode:
- `--cached` – reuse locally cached order data without calling the API (perfect with `--share`)
- Automatic caching activates when you run the script again within one minute of a successful API request, keeping Tesla happy with fewer calls.

## Configuration
### General Settings
The script stores the configuration in `data/private/settings.json`. Feel free to tweak it—if something breaks, the script falls back to default values.

On the first run the script detects your system language and stores it as `language` in the settings file. Edit this entry to override the language manually. If no translation is available yet, the setting is simply ignored until one becomes available.

### Option Codes
Known Tesla option codes are now downloaded on demand from
`https://www.tesla-order-status-tracker.de/scripts/php/fetch/option_codes.php` and
cached locally for 24 hours. The cache lives in `data/private/option_codes_cache.json`
and is refreshed automatically whenever it expires. You can still drop custom JSON
files into `data/public/option-codes` to override or extend the remote data; local
entries win if both define the same option code.

## History & Preview
The script stores the latest order information in `tesla_orders.json` and keeps a change log in `tesla_order_history.json`. Every detected difference—like a VIN assignment—is appended to the history file and displayed after the current status. The "Order Information" section always shows live data first, followed by historical changes.

## Telemetry
To better understand how the tool is used and to improve future development, the script can optionally send **anonymous usage statistics**.
On the very first launch you will be asked for consent. If you decline, nothing is sent. Declining has no negative impact other than not contributing to usage statistics.

### What information is sent?

- A randomly generated fingerprint that identifies your installation (not tied to your identity)
- For each tracked order: a pseudonymized order reference number and the associated Tesla model
- Which command line flags were used (e.g. `--details`, `--share`, `--status`, `--cached`)
- The operating system language (e.g. `en_US`)

### How is your data protected?
- **No personal data** such as VINs, names, email addresses, tokens, credentials or raw order IDs ever leave your machine.
- Order IDs are **irreversibly pseudonymized** locally using a secret-based HMAC before transmission. Even if someone had access to the data, it cannot be reversed into the original ID.
- The installation fingerprint is just a random string generated once on your system. It contains no information about your device or account.
- All traffic is sent over encrypted HTTPS.
- Data is used exclusively in aggregate to understand general usage patterns, not to track individual users.

### Controlling telemetry
You are always in control: telemetry is opt-in. Consent is requested on first run, and you can disable or revoke it at any time by editing the configuration file (`data/private/settings.json`) and setting `"telemetry-consent": false`.

## Issues
If you have any issues, running the script or getting error messages, pleas feel free to ask for help in the [isses](https://github.com/chrisi51/tesla-order-status/issues) section or pm me at the [tff-forum](https://tff-forum.de/u/chrisi51/summary)


## Disclaimer
- The script runs locally on your machine.
- No connection to me is made at any time unless you explicitly allow telemetry as described above.
- You need to log in via browser and return the resulting URL to the script to extract the login token used for the API.
- The script only uses the token to work with for the current session.
- With your permission the script stores the token on your hard disk.
